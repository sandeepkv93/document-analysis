  'Hello, I am having trouble accessing my account on your website. Whenever I try to log in, I receive an error message saying that my password is incorrect. I am certain that I am entering the correct password because I have it saved in my password manager. Additionally, I attempted to reset my password, but I never received the reset email in my inbox or spam folder. Could you please assist me in resolving this issue as soon as possible? I need access to my account urgently because I have an upcoming deadline and important documents stored there. I have also noticed that the website sometimes loads very slowly or times out entirely. I am using the latest version of Chrome on a Windows 10 PC. Please let me know if there are any troubleshooting steps I can follow on my end. Your prompt assistance would be greatly appreciated.';
